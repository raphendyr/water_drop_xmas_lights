# Christmas dripping icicle led lights

Code and electronis to implement nice xmas lights. These are very expensive in stores if even available.

I saw these kind of things in Helsinki last Christmas and desided to do some myself.

I found [this](http://ledchristmaslighting.com/index.php?main_page=index&cPath=178_78) site selling something similat what I came up with.
